# YAML Ain't Markup Language
# Basically yaml and yml are same
# btw, this is how we write comment in yaml

# scope in yaml is by indentation

person:
  # person object has all these values of different data types
  # key: 'value'
  name: &myname 'thisismyname'
  occupation: 'student'
  age: 200
  age_float: !!float 23  # data type conversion "23.0"
  gpa: 23.4
  gpa_str: !!str 23.4  # "3.5"
  fav_num: 1e+10
  male: true
  birthday: 2020-07-30 13:12:11  # ISO-86 format
  no_flaws: null

  # list of information
  hobbies:
    - hobby1
    - hobby2
    - hobby3
    - hobby4
  # this is also list
  movies: [ "movie1", "movie2", "movie3", "movie4", "movie5" ]

  # a complex list(list of object)
  friends:
    # first object in list
    - name: 'friend1'
      age: '150'
    # another way of defining object
    - {name: 'friend2', age: 151}
  # another way to define list item
    -
      name: "friend3"
      age: 152
  # all three different formats are equivalent in yaml
