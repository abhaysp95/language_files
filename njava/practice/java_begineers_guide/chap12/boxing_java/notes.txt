Number constructor has been deprecated since starting of JDK9, now we use 'valueOf()' method to encapsulate a value within a object, this process is called "boxing".

e.g.,	Integer iOb = Integer.valueOf(100);

The value 100 is said to be boxed inside iOb.

Prior, to JDK5, all boxing took place manually, like above example

The process of extracting a value from a type wrapper is called unboxing. Again, prior to JDK5, all unboxing took place manually, explicitly calling a method on the wrapper to obtain its value.

e.g.,	int i = iOb.intValue();


Autoboxing, by which a primitve type is automatically encapsulated(boxed) into its equivalent type wrapper whenever an object of type is needed. Same is said for auto-unboxing(extraction automatically from a type wrapper when its value is needed).

e.g., Integer iOb = 100;  // autoboxing an int

to unbox

e.g., int i = iOb;  // auto-unbox
