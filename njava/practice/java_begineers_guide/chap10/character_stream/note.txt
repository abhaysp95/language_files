System.in is a byte stream, you'll need to wrap System.in to some kind of Reader. The best class for reading console input is BufferedReader, which supports a buffered input stream. However, you cannot construct a BufferedReader directly from System.in, instead you have to use InputStreamReader which converts bytes to characters,

InputStreamReader(InputStream inpuStream)

Since, System.in refers to an object of type InputStream, it can be used for inputStream. Next,

BufferedReader(Reader inputReader)

Here, inputReader is the stream that is linked to the instance of BufferedReader being created. Putting it all together:

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
