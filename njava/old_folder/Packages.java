/**Java Packages -
  -- Packages are nothing more than the way we organize files into different directories according to their functionality, usability as well as category they should belong to.
  -- Files in one directory (or package) would have different functionality from those of another directory.
  -- For exmaple: files in java.io package do something related to I/O, but files in java.net give us the way to deal with network.
  -- Packaging also help us to avoid class name collision when we use the same name class name in different packages not in same.
  -- The benefits of using package reflect the ease of maintenance, organization and increase collaboration among developers.

  Now, let's see how to create Packages, I'm going to create HeyWorld.java file: We will write package <name> on the top most of program
  To compile we will use this syntax -> javac -d . HeyWorld.java

  -- One java file can only have one public class
  -- Name of the file should be same as the name of public class, if not then it can be of any class name.
