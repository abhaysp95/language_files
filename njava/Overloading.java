/** Fucntion Overloading in java

-> If two methods of a class(whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by a class, or one declared and one inherited) have the same name but signatures that are not same,then the method name is said to be overloaded.

-> Method overloading is a way  to implment polymorphism, because function are called by same name but at compile time it becomes clear which method is called.

-> Method overriding is defining a method in subclass with the same signature with specific implementation in respect to the subclass.
    Let, that there are some methods in parent class and child class inherits properties of parent class, but there are some method whose implementation you want to change in child class to work different then you do method overriding.
    So, for overloading name of the method should be same with different signature, for overriding name and signature both should be same.
