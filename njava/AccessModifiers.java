/**Java supports four catogories of accessebility rules
 - private
 - protected
 - public
 - default , if non of the upper is used then it is by default.

 -> Modifiers can be used for class, member variables and member functions.
 ->Used with Outer class and inner class
 ->For outer, either public or just class which means default
 ->For inner, any of the four.
 -> When memmbers of the class are private, they can not accessed from outside the class body. They are meant to be accessed from the samme class in which they are declared.
 -> When members are protected, they cann be accessed fromm any class of the same package and child class form other package.
 -> When members are public, they are accessible from any class of any package.
 -> When members are default, they are accessible only from the class of samme package.
