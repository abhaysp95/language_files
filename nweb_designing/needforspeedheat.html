		<p><font size="5">Need for Speed Heat is a racing game set in an open world environment called Palm City, a fictionalised version of the city of Miami, Florida and its surrounding area. The in-game map features diverse geography, including mountainous areas and open fields.[1] Unlike Need for Speed Payback, the game does not include a 24-hour day-night cycle, but players can switch between day and night. During the day, players can take part in sanctioned race events, which reward players with cash to spend on new cars and upgrades. They can also take part in illegal street races at night, which would earn players rep. The more rep player earns, the more aggressive the police will be during the night. Players must escape the cops and get back to their safehouse, before they are busted, or their car is wrecked. When players return to a safehouse, the rep they have earned during the night will be multiplied by their "Heat Level". If players are arrested, they will lose their rep multiplier, but will still receive their unmultiplied rep. The rep multiplier mechanic works similarly to the SpeedPoints multiplier from Rivals. The game also features a storyline in which the players interact with the cityâ€™s police force, led by authority figure Lt. Mercer.[2][3][4] Players can smash neon flamingos hidden within the map, which rewards them with a small amount of money or rep depending on the time of day. They can also find graffiti, referred to as "Street Art" in the game, and send it to the livery editor to use it on their car(s). Lastly, they can complete activities around the open world such as smashing billboards, beating scores on drift zones, getting the highest speeds passing through speed traps, and going the longest distances when performing long jumps. Players may complete "Crew Time Trials" which allows them to complete short timed events in an attempt to get the #1 spot on the leaderboard in their crew.</p></font>
		<h2><u>Plot</u></h2>
		<p><font size="5">The player (male player voiced by Andrew Lawrence, female player voiced by Jamie Gray Hyder)[a] arrives in Palm City for the Speedhunter Showdown, a citywide exhibition which draws in racers to compete in legally sanctioned races throughout the day, and illegal street races throughout the night. Lt. Frank Mercer (Josh Coxx), leader of the police department's High-Speed Task Force, announces his intent to ruthlessly pursue and arrest all street racers in the city. Lucas Rivera (Jonny Cruz), a local mechanic and retired street racer, sells the player their first car, helps the player enter their first Showdown race, and becomes their mechanic and mentor for much of the game. Lucas's younger sister, Ana Rivera (Ana Marte), is a street racer whose crew recently disbanded after a task force raid nearly killed one of her friends.</p>

The player joins Ana in a street race and she introduces them to The League, an exclusive crew of Palm City's best street racers, which she aspires to join, and which Lucas almost joined until he suddenly quit racing after their father died. Ana and the player form a new crew to climb the ranks of Palm City's street racers and earn a place in The League. After winning a race, Ana and the player are confronted by Officer Shaw (Josh Collins), a member of Mercer's task force, who has Ana's Nissan 350Z impounded. When Ana calls the city about her car later, they claim to have no record of it.

<p>The player and Ana race The Dreamkillers, another crew vying for The League's attention. After defeating them, they unexpectedly witness Shaw meeting Eva Torres (Shontae Saldana), another officer in Mercer's task force. Shaw shows Torres bags of money in the trunk of his car, extorted from street racers per Mercer's orders. Torres takes one of the bags but warns that Shaw and Mercer's growing brashness is endangering their unit's activities. Ana steals her father's 1967 Chevrolet Camaro from Lucas's shop so she can join the player in a final showdown against the Dreamkillers, but the race is interrupted by Shaw. The player wrecks Shaw's car, scattering the money from Shaw's trunk onto the street, which creates a publicized spectacle and raises public suspicion about Mercer's and the High-Speed Task Force's activities. However, Lucas is angered by Ana using their father's car without permission.</p>

<p>Ana and the player are contacted by Torres, who admits that the High-Speed Task Force is corrupt, but wishes to have Mercer taken down because he's become too reckless. Torres leads them to a warehouse that acts as an illegal chop shop, stripping cars seized by the High-Speed Task Force, or preparing them to be shipped out of the city. Ana realizes her 350Z has already been processed after finding its license plate.</p></font>
