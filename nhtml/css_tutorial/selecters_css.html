		<h1>This is first heading</h1>
		<p>Here are some contents for the first paragraph.
 The shadow exclude options are helpful if you have shadows enabled. Due to the way picom draws its shadows, certain applications will have visual glitches
# (most applications are fine, only apps that do weird things with xshapes or argb are affected).
# This list includes all the affected apps I found in my testing. The "! name~=''" part excludes shadows on any "Unknown" windows, this prevents a visual glitch with the XFWM alt tab switcher.</p>
		<h2>Here is second heading</h2>

	# GLX backend: GLX buffer swap method we assume.
	# Could be undefined (0), copy (1), exchange (2), 3-6, or buffer-age (-1).
	# undefined is the slowest and the safest, and the default value.
	# copy is fastest, but may fail on some drivers,
	# 2-6 are gradually slower but safer (6 is still faster than 0).
	# Usually, double buffer means 2, triple buffer means 3.
	# buffer-age means auto-detect using GLX_EXT_buffer_age, supported by some drivers.
	# Useless with --glx-use-copysubbuffermesa.
	# Partially breaks --resize-damage.
	# Defaults to undefined.
	#glx-swap-method = "undefined";
